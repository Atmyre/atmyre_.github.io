- DL researcher, [**LAMBDA HSE**](https://cs.hse.ru/en/lambda/), 2018-2020  

  DL research in hight energy physics domain  

  I was working on generaive adversarial models applied to high energy physics  
  
  Responsibilities: read & write scientific papers, conduct experiments, generate ideas, build AI pipelines  

- SRE Intern, **Google Dublin**, 2019  

  During my internship I developed large-scale hierarchical graph clustering algorithm for internal services graphs representations

- Developer-researcher intern, **Yandex**, 2017  

  During my internship I applied RL ti different metrics to seq2seq vocalization task. Combined different seq2seq vocalization models using ideas from Actor-Mimic algorithm. Showed that RL could increase quality of seq2seq models. My bachelor's thesis was based on this work.
